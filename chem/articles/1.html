    <h1 class="title">Recycling rare earth elements is hard. Science is trying to make it easier</h1>
    <p>By Erin Wayman</p>
    <h4>Our modern lives depend on rare earth elements, and someday soon we may not have enough to meet growing demand.<br></h4>

      <h4>Because of their special properties, these 17 metallic elements are crucial ingredients in computer screens, cell phones
      and other electronics, compact fluorescent lamps, medical imaging machines, lasers, fiber optics, pigments, polishing
      powders, industrial catalysts – the list goes on and on (SN Online: 1/16/23). Notably rare earths are an essential part
      of the high-powered magnets and rechargeable batteries in the electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies needed
      to get the world to a low- or zero-carbon future. <br></h4>
<h4>In 2021, the world mined 280,000 metric tons of rare earths — roughly 32 times as much as was mined in the mid-1950s. And demand is only going to increase. By 2040, experts estimate, we’ll need up to seven times as much rare earths as we do today.</h4>
<h4>Satisfying that appetite won’t be easy. Rare earth elements are not found in concentrated deposits. Miners must excavate huge amounts of ore, subject it to physical and chemical processes to concentrate the rare earths, and then separate them. The transformation is energy intensive and dirty, requiring toxic chemicals and often generating a small amount of radioactive waste that must be safely disposed of. Another concern is access: China has a near monopoly on both mining and processing; the United States has just one active mine (SN Online: 1/1/23).</h4>
<h4>For most of the jobs rare earths do, there are no good substitutes. So to help meet future demand and diversify who controls the supply — and perhaps even make rare earth recovery “greener” — researchers are looking for alternatives to conventional mining.   </h4>
<h4>Proposals include everything from extracting the metals from coal waste to really out-there ideas like mining the moon. But the approach most likely to make an immediate dent is recycling. “Recycling is going to play a very important and central role,” says Ikenna Nlebedim, a materials scientist at Ames National Laboratory in Iowa and the Department of Energy’s Critical Materials Institute. “That’s not to say we’re going to recycle our way out of the critical materials challenge.”</h4>
<h4>Still, in the rare earth magnets market, for instance, by about 10 years from now, recycling could satisfy as much as a quarter of the demand for rare earths, based on some estimates. “That’s huge,” he says.</h4>
<h4>But before the rare earths in an old laptop can be recycled as regularly as the aluminum in an empty soda can, there are technological, economic and logistical obstacles to overcome.</h4>
