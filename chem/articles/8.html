    <h1 class="title">Catastrophic solar storms may not explain shadows of radiation in trees</h1>
    <p>By Nikk Ogasa</p>
    <h4>A cryptic chemical signature of unknown origins, hidden for centuries inside the trunks of Earth’s trees, just became even more mysterious.<br><br>

In the last decade, scientists have discovered traces on Earth of six intense bursts of radiation, known as Miyake events, scattered over the last 9,300 years. The most popular explanation is that these mysterious signatures were left behind by massive solar storms, leading some scientists to warn that the next Miyake event could cripple the world’s electrical grid. But new research, published in the October Proceedings of the Royal Society A, suggests that more than just solar flares might be behind the enigmatic radiation.<br><br>
The finding underscores the need for further investigations into these strange bursts, which could potentially harm our society in the future, says physicist Gianluca Quarta of the University of Salento in Lecce, Italy, who was not involved in the study. “Something is not fitting with what we know at the moment.”<br><br>

Miyake events were first discovered in trees. As trees grow, their trunks accrue layers, or rings, which lock in chemical signatures from their surroundings. By analyzing the composition of individual tree rings, researchers can uncover clues about environmental conditions going back thousands of years (SN: 6/1/20).<br><br>

In 2012, physicist Fusa Miyake of Nagoya University in Japan was studying Japanese cedar tree rings when she found a sharp spike in radiocarbon — a variant of carbon that can form when cosmic radiation strikes Earth’s atmosphere — in rings dating to about A.D. 774. Since then, five other similar bursts, now named Miyake events, have been detected in tree rings around the world as well as in polar ice cores.<br><br>

Due to the spikes’ global occurrence, many scientists contend that the events have an extraterrestrial origin. The most popular explanation is that especially large solar storms, or flares, blasted Earth with big bursts of radiation (SN: 2/26/21).<br><br></h4>
